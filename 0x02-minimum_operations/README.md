## Minimum operations 

 Minimum Operations is a simple command-line tool designed to solve various computational problems that involve finding the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific goal. Whether you're working on optimizing an algorithm, solving mathematical puzzles, or tackling efficiency challenges, this tool can help you determine the minimum steps needed to reach your objective.

### * Algorithm complexity Analysis: 
 In computer science, when analyzing algorithms, "minimum operations" can refer to the fewest number of basic operations (such as comparisons, additions, or multiplications) required to complete a particular task. For example, finding the minimum number in an unsorted list using a sorting algorithm might involve finding the algorithm with the fewest comparisons.
