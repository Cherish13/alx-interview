##0x01. Lockboxes

In the context of "lockboxes" refers to a collection of boxes that are locked and can be opened using keys. Each box is a represented as a list, and the index in the outer list represents the box number.

The goal is to determine if it is possible to unlock all the boxes starting from the first box (boxes[0]). A key with the same number as a box can be used to unlock that box. The task is to check if, using the available keys, it is possible to unlock all the boxes in the collection.
